Android compound views for mnaging settings

A collection of compound views that I tend to be using in almost all of my Android projects (because I'm bored by PreferenceFragment).
The views look like the setting-groups of the AOSP settings app.

Types:
- Button Setting
- Radiogroup Setting
- Seekbar Setting
- Switch Setting
